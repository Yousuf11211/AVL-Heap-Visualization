# AVL-Heap-Visualization
An enhanced version of the AVL Tree and Heap Visualization Tool by galles that offers interactive and intuitive visualizations of AVL trees and heaps. This project introduces new features to improve functionality and make the tool more versatile for understanding data structures.

# Features
# AVL Tree Visualization
  # Random Key Insertion: 
    Users can insert random keys sequentially into the AVL tree with animations. After each insertion, a delay is added to      allow the animation to complete.
  # Balanced Insertion: 
    The tree automatically balances itself after each insertion.
  # Interactive Input:
    Users can specify the number of random elements to insert, and the input field clears automatically after pressing the 
    'Random' button.
# Heap Visualization
  # Custom Key Deletion:
    Users can specify a key to delete from the heap. After deletion, the heap is automatically balanced.
  # Interactive Controls:
    Users can insert random elements, delete a key, and view the changes in real-time.
  # Color Customization:
    The visualization uses an orange and grey color scheme to match the AVL tree styling for consistency.
# Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/avl-heap-visualization.git
Open the home.html file in your browser to view the visualizations.

# Usage
